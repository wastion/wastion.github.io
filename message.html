                            <p>Dear friend,</p>
                            <p>A lot of us look down on selling ourselves— because we equate it with ‘selling out.’</p>
                            <p><span id="more-38834"></span></p>
                            <p>But if you want to thrive as an entrepreneur, artist, or whatever— you need to learn how to sell
                                yourself.
                            </p>
                            <p>First of all, no matter how good your product is, if you don’t know how to market yourself —
                                you will never put it out there.</p>
                            <p>For example, if you’re a painter, and you have all these amazing paintings locked up in your
                                basement— nobody could appreciate your art unless you exhibit them, sell them, or share them
                                with the public.</p>
                            <p>If you’re a photographer, you can be the most brilliant photographer in the world, but without
                                sharing your photos or publishing them, nobody will be able to experience the beauty of your
                                images.
                            </p>
                            <h2>What is ‘selling yourself’ versus ‘selling out’?</h2>
                            <p>To ‘sell’ yourself is different than ‘selling out.’</p>
                            <p>To sell yourself is to have confidence in yourself, and to put your work out there. It doesn’t
                                necessarily mean having to sell yourself for a price. It just means putting confidence and
                                faith behind yourself, and your creative work.</p>
                            <p>For me, ‘selling out’ means to betray your morals and ideals. You can ‘sell out’ in many different
                                ways. For betraying your inner-moral compass for money. To betray your friends for some monetary
                                or prestigious gain. To accept things that you don’t believe in.</p>
                            <p>Trust me, I’ve sold out and prostituted myself in many different ways. And whenever I do it,
                                I feel dirty. I don’t mind selling my services for money, but whenever I do it— I make sure
                                to do it for a lot of money. But in terms of my true moral inner-compass, which I truly believe
                                in, I try to never betray myself.
                            </p>
                            <p>The test is to just look at yourself in the mirror, and to be comfortable with the person you
                                see in the mirror. It also means to go to sleep with a care-free conscience. If you ever
                                feel any disconnect or ‘cognitive dissonance’ or inner-stress or turmoil, you need to change
                                something in your life.</p>
                            <h2>How to sell yourself as an artist</h2>
                            <p>Going back to selling yourself as an artist— I want to share some practical tips:</p>
                            <h2>1. Publish your work</h2>
                            <p>First of all, if you have good creative work, publish it. Put it in a magazine, a book, or on
                                the internet. Use whatever platform is best for you.</p>
                            <p>If you never publish your work or share it, your work doesn’t exist.</p>
                            <h2>2. Own your platform</h2>
                            <p>As a general rule, I like to own my own platform (like owning my own blog, and not just being
                                overly-dependent on social media).</p>
                            <p>For example, to build an audience on social media (Facebook, Instagram) is to be a slave of Facebook.
                                Because you might have 100,000 fans on Facebook (or followers on Instagram), but you need
                                to pay Facebook money in order to share your stuff with your fans.</p>
                            <p>For example, if I have 100,000 fans on Facebook, and I share a post, I might only reach 1% of
                                my audience. But if I pay Facebook $50, I might reach up to 25% of my audience.</p>
                            <p>A better solution— create a newsletter. I use <a href="http://mailchimp.com">mailchimp.com</a>                                — and pay money for the service, in order to get email sign ups. This means, whenever I have
                                an update, and I send it out to my newsletter, it gets sent directly to the inboxes of my
                                followers. Whether they open it or not isn’t in my control, but the ‘deliverability’ rate
                                is very high, and my ‘open rate’ for the emails are generally 40%-50%.
                            </p>
                            <p>Also, I ‘own’ my platform of this blog. I use <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>,
                                and have a self-hosted blog. This means I have full control how to customize the look and
                                interface of my blog. Whereas if you only publish your photos on Facebook/Instagram — you
                                are at the mercy of Facebook (and yes, Facebook also owns Instagram, they are the same company
                                now).
                            </p>
                            <p>So if you want to own your own platform, I recommend signing up for a website (I recommend <a
                                    href="http://bluehost.com">bluehost.com</a>) and installing <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>                                on your site.</p>
                            <p>This will allow you to publish your photos however you want, thoughts, or ideas.</p>
                            <h2>3. Charge money for your product or services</h2>
                            <p>If you an artist, to ‘sell yourself’ — you need to charge money.</p>
                            <p>For myself, I would rather earn $100 dollars rather than getting 1000 likes on social media.
                                Cold, hard cash will help you pay for coffee and rent. Likes don’t pay your heater bill,
                                or keep you warm at night.
                            </p>
                            <p>So don’t get distracted by likes on social media. They really don’t mean anything.</p>
                            <p>Charge money for your products or services. If you are an artist, sell your art work. And don’t
                                sell it for cheap. Charge 25% <em>more</em> than you think you should. Many of us (myself
                                included) are insecure about ourselves as artists. We always under-sell ourselves. My suggestion:
                                <strong>over-sell yourself</strong>. This is the only way we can build confidence in ourselves
                                as artists.</p>
                            <p>What is your time worth to you? What is your labor worth to you? Whatever you sell yourself for,
                                don’t sell yourself for cheap.</p>
                            <p>As a general business rule, it is always better to price high— then your client can match you
                                a little lower.
                            </p>
